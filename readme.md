We are developing an application that allows freelancers to track their projects and outstanding invoices using the Laravel framework. This application allows users to create an account, projects, and clients; track project and invoice deadlines; and track follow-up actions with existing clients. Users can view their information in a high-level dashboard view or in detailed page views. The hallmarks of this project are simplistic design, intuitive information architecture, and modular, easily-maintainable code.
